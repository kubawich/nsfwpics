	Acceptance of the Terms of Service
	The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these "Terms of Service"), govern your access to and use of https://nsfwpics.pw/ ("we", "us", "our", ours" and/or the "Websites"), including any content, functionality and services offered on or through the Websites, whether as model ("Model") or a registered user ("User"). These Terms of Service apply to the Websites, web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, social network "tabs", or other online or wireless offerings that post a link to these Terms of Service, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology, manner or means.
	Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Websites. By using the Websites or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Websites.
	If you access or use the Websites, whether you click to accept or not, you agree to all of the various terms in these Terms of Service. If you do not understand all of these Terms of Service, you should consult an attorney before agreeing to any of the Terms of Service.
	You consent to entering these Terms of Service electronically, and to storage of records related to these Terms of Service in electronic form.
	When using the Websites, you shall be subject to any posted rules, community guidelines, or policies. Such rules, guidelines, and policies are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. We may also offer other Websites that are governed by different Terms of Service.
	Ability to Accept Terms of Service
	You affirm that you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction you are accessing the Websites from, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. If you are under 18 or the applicable age of majority, you are not permitted to submit personal information to us or use the Websites. You also represent that the jurisdiction from which you access the Websites does not prohibit the receiving or viewing of sexually explicit content.
	Changes to the Terms of Service
	We may modify or revise these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version, so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.
	If we change anything in these Terms of Service, the change will be reflected in the "last modified date". You agree that you will periodically review these terms and refresh the page when doing so. You agree to note the date of the last revision of these terms. If the "last modified" date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed these terms, then they are unchanged. On the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review the terms, and you agree to the new ones.
	All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Websites thereafter. The updated version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior version(s) shall have no continuing legal effect. If you do not review new terms as posted, then you agree that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you failed to review the new ones. You are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is your own omission. By continuing to use the Websites subsequent to us making available an amended version of these Terms of Service, you thereby acknowledge, agree to and consent to such amendment.
